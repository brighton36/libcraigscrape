# =craigwatch - A email-based "post monitoring" solution
#
# Created alongside the libcraigscrape library, libcraigwatch was designed to take the monotony out of regular 
# craiglist monitoring. craigwatch is designed to be run at periodic intervals (hourly/daily/etc) through crontab 
# and report all new postings within a listing or search url, since its last run, by email.
#
# For more information, head to the {craiglist monitoring}[http://www.derosetechnologies.com/community/libcraigscrape] help section of our website.
#
# == Features
# In additon to its report tracking, craigwatch offers many post search and filtering options that offer much imrpoved
# and more accurate results then does craigslist's search functions. Post filtering options include:
# - has_image - yes/no
# - price_required - yes/no
# - price_greater_than - (int)
# - price_less_than - (int)
# - full_post_has - (array of string or regexp) Only post whose full-post's contents contains/matches
# - full_post_has_no - (array of string or regexp) Only post whose full-post's contents_ contains doesn't contain/match
# - summary_post_has - (array of string or regexp) Only post whose listing's label contains/matches
# - summary_post_has_no - (array of string or regexp) Only post whose listing's label doesn't contain/match
# - summary_or_full_post_has - (array of string or regexp) Filter's out results which don't match either the post label <b>or</b> the post contents
# - summary_or_full_post_has_no - (array of string or regexp)  Filter's out results which match either the post label <b>or</b> the post contents
# - location_has - (array of string or regexp) Only include posts which match against the post location
# - location_has_no - (array of string or regexp) Only include posts which don't match against the post location
#
# Multiple searches can be combined into a single report, and results can be sorted by newest-first or oldest-first (default)
# 
# Reporting output is easily customized html, handled by ActionMailer, and emails can be delivered via smtp or sendmail.
# Database tracking of already-delivered posts is handled by ActiveRecord, and its driver-agnostic SQL supports all the 
# major backends (sqllite/mysql/postgres/probably-all-others). Database sizes are contained by automatically pruning old results
# that are no longer required at the end of each run.
#
# Pretty useful, no?
# 
# == Installation
# craigwatch is coupled with libcraigscrape, and is installed via ruby gems. However, since we focused on keeping the 
# libcraigscrape download 'lightweight' some additional gems need to be installed in addition to the initial libcraigscrape
# gem itself. 
#
# This should take care of the craigwatch install on all systems:
#    sudo gem install libcraigscrape kwalify activerecord actionmailer
# Alternatively, if you've already installed libcraigscrape and want to start working with craigwatch:
#    sudo gem install kwalify activerecord actionmailer
# 
# This script was initially developed with activerecord 2.3, actionmailer 2.3 and kwalify 0.7, but will likely work with most 
# prior and future versions of these libraries.
# 
# == Usage
# When craigwatch is invoked, it is designed to run a single report and then terminate. There is only one parameter to craigwatch, and 
# this parameter is the path to a valid report-definition yml file. ie:
#    craigwatch johns_daily_watch.yml
#
# There is an included kwalify schema which can validate your definition files, but craigwatch will automatically do so at startup.
# Probably, the best way to understand the report definition files, is to look at the annotated sample file below, and use it as a
# starting point for your own.
#
# By default there is no program output, however, setting any of the following paramters to 'yes' in your definition file will turn on
# useful debugging/logging output:
# - debug_database
# - debug_mailer
# - debug_craigscrape
#
# == Definition File Sample
#
# Let's start with a minimal report, just enough needed to get something quick working: 
#    # We need some kind of destination to send this to
#    email_to: Chris DeRose <cderose@derosetechnologies.com>
#    
#    # This is an array of specific 'searches' we'll be performing in this report:
#    searches:
#         # We're looking for 90's era cadillac, something cheap, confortable and in white...
#       - name: 90's White/Creme Convertible Cadillacs
#
#         # This starting date is mostly for the first run, and gives us a reasonable cut-off point from whcih to build.
#         # Its optional, and if omitted, craigwatch defaults to 'yesterday'
#         starting: 9/10/09
#
#         # We want to check all the labels, and filter out years not in the 90's, and cars not made by cadillac
#         summary_post_has:
#            - /(?:^|[^\d]|19)9[\d](?:[^\dk]|$)/i
#            - /cadillac/i
#
#         # I said we're looking for something *comfortable* !
#         summary_post_has_no: [ /xlr/i ]
#
#         # We were convertable, and white/cream/etc:
#         full_post_has: 
#            - /convertible/i
#            - /(white|yellow|banana|creme|cream)/i
#
#         # Convertible - not *simulated* convertible!
#         full_post_has_no:
#            - /simulated[^a-z]{0,2}convertible/i
#
#         # We want to search all of craigslist's in the us, and we'll want to find it using 
#         # the '/search/cta?hasPic=1&query=cadillac' url on the site
#         sites: [ us ]
#         listings:
#            - /search/cta?hasPic=1&query=cadillac
#
# Here's another annotated report which uses most of the other available craigwatch features:
#
#    # The report_name is fed into Time.now.strftime, hence the formatting characters
#    report_name: Craig Watch For Johnathan on %D at %I:%M %p
#
#    email_to: Johnathan Peabody <john@example.local>
#
#    # This is sent straight into ActiveRecord, so there's plenty of options available here. the following is an easy
#    # default sqlite store that should work on most any system with a minimal overhead
#    tracking_database: { adapter: sqlite3, dbfile: /home/john/john_cwatch_report.db }
#
#    searches:
#       # Search #1:
#       - name: Schwinn Bikes For Sale in/near New York
#         starting: 9/10/2009
#
#         # Scrape the following sites/servers:
#         sites: [ us/ny/newyork, us/nj/southjersey ]
#
#         # Scrape the following listings pages:
#         listings: [ bik ]
#
#         # We want listings with Schwinn in the summary
#         summary_post_has: [ /schwinn/i ]
#
#         # We're only interested in adult bikes, so scrap any results that mentions chidren or kids
#         full_post_has_no: [ /(children|kids)/i ]
#
#         # Oh, and we're on a budget:
#         price_less_than: 120
#     
#       # Search #2
#       - name: Large apartment rentals in San Francisco
#         sites: [ us/ca/sfbay ]
#         starting: 9/10/2009
#    
#         # We're going to rely on craigslist's built-in search for this one since there's a lot of listings, and we 
#         # want to conserve some bandwidth
#         listings: [ /search/apa?query=pool&minAsk=min&maxAsk=max&bedrooms=5 ]
#
#         # We'll require a price to be listed, 'cause it keeps out some of the unwanted fluff
#         price_required: yes
# 
#         # Hopefully this will keep us away from a bad part of town:
#         price_greater_than: 1000        
#
#         # Since we dont have time to driv to each location, we'll require only listings with pictures
#         has_image: yes
