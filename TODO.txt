* All our report outputs have -'s now. Maybe those shouldn't be part of the title
* Do we want to better parse zones by having a geography singleton, with a default_zone method?
  * Remove the Time.zone = 'UTC' and see that the tests still pass (in the libcraigscrape). I think they should
  * Yea - we should...
  * Write some specs that test for this, fix them, and then adjust the old test code failures to reflect the new functionality
    (Just to be clear, the test_posting is currently *wrong*)
------------------------------------------
Possible features?:
  * Clean up the filters code a bit and get them testing
  * And maybe we can use the typhoeus lib a bit more to better speed up the runs
    * And we might need to add that retry-404's thing again
  * FEATURE: Rather then 'search/sss?query=artist+needed', maybe use CraigScrape::search_for('artist needed')
  * FEATURE: Support for post submissions?
  * FEATURE: Stats in the email: bytes transferred, generation time, urls scrapped, posts scrapped
  * FEATURE: We might want to parse the sub-locations in the geo-location code... (so for miami: brw/mia/wpb)
